For example:
G7 - Use a dedicated node to store and represent globally-relevant data (e.g., the physical environment where the system operates) and use it as the single source of truth for all the other nodes in the system
Irrespective of the fact that I am not aware that this is considered best practice, I would expect the ROS framework to have a ""GlobalStoreNode"" or something, which allows for an easy way to enforce this guideline. 
Or, a more striking example:
G20 - The spinning rate for nodes should be configurable so that they can operate according to available computational resources
To enable this, make an *automatically* dynamically configurable SpinDuration class, and ensure that any spin function call only accepts those.

Lastly, I feel that the following two Guidelines cannot exist together:
G31 - If a node is stateful and its behavior strongly depends on the time and order of arrival of messages, specify the protocol of the messages expected by the node
G32 - ROS nodes must be stateless and their behaviour should not depend on previous operations or received messages

The fact that these two guidelines were so contradictory made me confused about the goal of this list: I believe the question was ""Which of these guidelines (which are all true and correct) would have been good to know about before you started developing?"", although I now think perhaps it was also a little bit ""Which of these guidelines do you believe are true, correct, and useful for people to know?""",All of this is good for the Discussion part.

The code base evolves constantly, but is never architected from scratch, as the robot would be dead for a few years at least, and probably forever. We also never redesign nodes afaik, we're stretched enough to keep the thing running and make improvements in its functioning.

""how to design nodes"" is thus largely a non-relevant question, we got them as-is due to design decisions taken a decade ago, and it's hard to change them.",This may be useful in the Discussion for telling that some robotics developers do not have enough sensibility w.r.t. architectural practices?
