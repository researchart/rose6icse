This folder contains the replication package of the paper published at ICSE SEIP 2020 with the title *How do you Architect your Robots? State of the Practice and Guidelines for ROS-based Systems*.

We are applying for the **Reusable** and **Available** Badges because this repository contains, among others, the following artifacts:

- The **full dataset** on which the findings of the paper are based;

- All the **Python scripts** we developed for performing each single step we applied for building the dataset (each Python script is executable in isolation);

- All **intermediate data** we produced when building the dataset, each as self-contained artifact;

- The **R script** we developed for analyzing the mined data;

- Other **auxiliary Python scripts**, such as those for cloning GitHub repositories as a bulk operation, programmatically visiting web pages, etc.   

- The README and INSTALL **guides** containing explicit instructions about how to reuse and execute all the software artifacts mentioned above for future studies.
