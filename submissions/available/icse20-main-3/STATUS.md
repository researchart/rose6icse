# Badge(s) Description
We want to apply for reusable and available badges. 
- All data can be publicly accessed via GitHub.
- The data is well documented. In the data, we provide the Stack Overflow post IDs and GitHub commit links of DNN bugs to support the developers in their future studies. 
- We provide an INSTALL.md file to show the data structure and how to reuse the data.
- The data can be easily extended by several methods. For instance, we can extend the artifact by mining more Stack Overflow questions or GitHub commits. It also can be extended by using other open-source websites or Q&A websites.
