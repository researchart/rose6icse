% piecewise_const - Generates a piecewise constant signal.
% Currently piecewise_const only supports 1D signals.
%
% The interface of piecewise_const is the same as with interp1.
%
% yi = piecewise_const(x,y,xi)
%
% INPUTS: 
% x - a vector of x coordinates such that anywhere between x(i) and x(i+1) 
%     the output value is y(i)
% y - the y coordinate of the vector
% xi - a vector with x coordinates where we would like to get the y value
%
% See also: interp1
