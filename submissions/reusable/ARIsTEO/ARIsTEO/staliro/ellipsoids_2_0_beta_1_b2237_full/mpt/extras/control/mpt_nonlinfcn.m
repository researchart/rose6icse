function sys = mpt_nonlinfcn(flag, x, u, mode)
% MPT_NONLINFCN Template function for (piecewise) nonlinear systems
%
% This is a template function for defining nonlinear or piecewise nonlinear
% systems. The function is divided into four main parts which are executed
% depending on the value of the "flag" input.
%
% In the "info" part, the user provides parameters which define system
% dimensions and constraints. If certain constraints are not known, or the
% user does not want to impose them, respective fields can be defined as empty
% matrices.
%
% In the "state" part, the state update equations are specified as (possibly
% nonlinear) functions of the states (denoted by "x") and inputs (denoted by
% "u"). If the system is piecewise nonlinear, one state update equation per each
% segment must be specified. Index of a respective segment is provided in the
% "mode" variable.
%
% The purpose of the "output" section is to define the output equation as a
% function of system states and system inputs. Again, one output equation per
% segment must be given if the system is piecewise nonlinear.
%
% Finally, the "guards" section specifies portions of the state-input space
% where a given segment (one piece of the piecewise nonlinear dynamics) is
% active. The equations can again be specified using the state and input
% variables.
%
% To create a system structure based on this template, simply call following
% command:
%
%   sysStruct = mpt_sys(@function_name)
