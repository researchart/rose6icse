% currently we cannot impose such bounds if we have nonlinear guards.

% NOTE NOTE NOTE!!!
% this is a hack! export(), depending on the default solver, either sets
% "model.binary_variables" or "model.integer_variables". however the latter is
% not (currently) being used in yalmip2mpt(). since integer variables are not
% supported in YALMIP's interface to MPT, they are treated as binaries.
% therefore we have to update "model.binary_variables" accordingly, otherwise
% mpt_getInput() will think that the model has no binaries.
