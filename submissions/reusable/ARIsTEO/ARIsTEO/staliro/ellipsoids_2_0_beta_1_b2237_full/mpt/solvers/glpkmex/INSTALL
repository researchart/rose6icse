GLPKMEX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
**********************************

GLPKMEX is a Matlab MEX Interface for the GLPK library developed by 
Andrew Makhorin. GLPKMEX is developed by Nicolo' Giorgetti, email 
giorgetti __ at __ ieee.org.
 

--> Standard installation procedure (suitable for most users):

1) Download and install GLPK;

2) Start Matlab and run makeglpkmex.m. Specify correct path to both GLPK 
   directory and eventually to the GLPK include and library directories.

3) Test the interface on the examples included (glpktest1.m, glpktest2.m, 
   glpksparse.m). Everything should works fine.

--> Specific installation procedure for those who use CYGWIN under Win*

Requirements:

A) The last version of cygwin, downloadable from http://www.cygwin.com
   (or download mingw)
B) Gnumex: http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/

1) Download GLPK and install it by specifying CFLAGS="-O3 -mno-cygwin" as 
   argument of make, i.e.: 
      a) ./configure;
      b) make CFLAGS="-O3 -mno-cygwin"
      c) make install
   This avoid to build a glpk library which needs of cygwin1.dll to run.  
   
2) Start Matlab and run gnumex. Make a mexopts.bat with option 'cygwin-mingw' if 
   you are using cygwin or 'mingw' if you are using mingw.

3) run makeglpkmex.m. Specify correct path to GLPK directory and eventually to 
   the GLPK include and library directories. Moreover, you have to specify the 
   location of mexopts.bat file generated at step 2).

4) Test the interface on the examples included (glpktest1.m, glpktest2.m, 
   glpksparse.m). Everything should works fine.
