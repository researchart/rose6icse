%  h = fourier(H,ax,tol,qtol)
%
%  C implementation of the fourier elimination algorithm
%
% Inputs:
%  H           = [A b] - Ax < b defines a polyhedron
%  ax          = dimensions of A onto which we want to project
%  tol  [1e-6] = numerical tolerance before two numbers are considered equal
%  qtol [1e-2] = angle in degrees between two vectors before they are
%                considered equal
%
% Outputs:
%  h = [A b] - Ax < b defines the projection of the polyhedron
