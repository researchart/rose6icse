% A recent and devloping extension in YALMIP is support
% for nonlinear operators such as min, max, norm and more.
%
% Although nonlinear, and often non-differentiable, the resulting
% optmization problem is in many cases still convex, and
% can be modelled using suitable additional variables and constraits.
%
% If these operators are used, YALMIP will derive a suitable
% convex model and solve the resulting problem. It may also happen
% that YALMIP fails to build a convex model, since the rules to detect
% convexity only are sufficient but not necessary.
%
% These extended operators should only be used of you now how
% to model them manually, why it can be done and when it can be done.

% To begin with, define some scalars
sdpvar x y z

% Nonlinear expressions are easily defined
p = min(x+y+norm([x;y],1),x)-max(min(x,y),max(x,y));

% The result is a linear variable, but it is special.
% This can be seen when displayed (note the "derived")
p

% These expressions can be used as any other expression
% in YALMIP. The difference is when optmization problems
% are solved. YALMIP will start by trying to expand the
% definitions of the derived variables, and try to maintain
% convexity while doing so.

solvesdp([],norm(residuals));

% ...and here is an example where YALMIP fails to prove convexity
% (this problem is convex)

% and will most likely be improved in a future version.

% The nonlinear operators currently supported are
%
% ABS      : Absolute value of matrix    
% MIN      : Minimum of column values    
% MAX      : Minimum of column values    
% SUMK     : Sum of k largest (eigen-) values
% SUMABSK  : Sum of k largest (by magniture) (eigen-) values 
% GEOMEAN2 : (Almost) Geometric mean of (eigen-) values (used for determinant maximization). 
%
% Adding new operators is rather straightforward and is 
% described in the HTML-manual
