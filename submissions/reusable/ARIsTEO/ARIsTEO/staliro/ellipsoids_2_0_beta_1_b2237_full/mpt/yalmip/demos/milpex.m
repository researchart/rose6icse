% YALMIP supports mixed integer (LP/QP/SOCP/SDP) programming.  If no
% specialized MIP solver is installed, such as GLPK or CPLEX, an internal 
% branch-and bound scheme is applied, using the installed continuous 
% solvers for solving the node problems. 
%
% Notice that this is a very rudimentary branch-and-bound solver, so
% for performance and anything but small academic examples, a dedicated 
% integer solver is required.
%
% Type help bnb to obtain inforamtion about the solver.
%
% Let us test the internal solver on MILP, MIQP, MISOCP and MISDPP
