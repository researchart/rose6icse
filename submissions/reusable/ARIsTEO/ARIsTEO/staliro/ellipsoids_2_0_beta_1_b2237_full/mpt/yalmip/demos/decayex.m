% Advanced YALMIP modeling, generalized eigenvalue problem
%
%*********************************************************
% 
% The problem we solve here is estimatation of decay-rate
% of a linear system x' = Ax. 
%
% This can be formulated as
%
% max alpha
% s.t A'P+PA < -2alphaP
%          P > I
%
pause

% Define the variables
A = [-1 2;-3 -4];
P = sdpvar(2,2);
pause

 %To find a lower bound on alpha, we solve a standard Lyapunov stability problem. 
F = set(P>eye(2))+set(A'*P+P*A < -eye(2));
pause
solvesdp(F,trace(P));
P0 = double(P)
pause

%For this particular solution, the decay-rate is
alpha_lower = -max(eig(inv(P0)*(A'*P0+P0*A)))/2
pause

% We now find an upper bound on the decay-rate by doubling alpha until
% the problem is infeasible. To find out if the problem is infeasible,
% we check the problem field in the solution structure. The
% meaning of this variable is explained in the help text for the command 
% yalmiperror. Infeasibility is detected if the value is 1. To
% reduce the amount of information written on the screen, we run the
% solver in a completely silent mode. This can be accomplished by
% using the verbose and warning options in sdpsettings.
%
% Note, on some solvers, just checking infeasibility flag is not enough. A
% more careful bisection code should check also for numerical problems that 
% could indicate infeasibility
