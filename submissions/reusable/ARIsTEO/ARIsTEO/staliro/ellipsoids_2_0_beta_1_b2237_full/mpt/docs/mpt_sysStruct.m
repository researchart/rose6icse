%MPT_SYSSTRUCT System structure description
%
% System structure (sysStruct) is a structure which describes the system to be
% controlled. MPT can deal with two types of systems:
% 1. Discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
% 2. Discrete-time Piecewise Affine (PWA) Systems
%
% Both system types can be subject to constraints imposed on control inputs and system
% outputs. In addition, constraints on slew rate of the control inputs can also
% be given.
%
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% LTI SYSTEMS
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% In general, a constrained linear time-invariant system is defined by the
% following relations:
%
%    x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k)
%     y(k)  = C x(k) + D u(k)
%
% Such an LTI system is defined by the following MANDATORY fields:
%
%    sysStruct.A = A;
%    sysStruct.B = B;
%    sysStruct.C = C;
%    sysStruct.D = D;
%
% An uncertain LTI system is driven by the following set of relations:
%
%    x(k+1) = Aunc x(k) + Bunc u(k) + w(k)
%     y(k)  = C x(k) + D u(k)
%
% where w(k) is an unknown, but bounded additive disturbance, i.e.
%    w(n) \in W  \forall n = 0...Inf
%
% To specify an additive disturbance, set "sysStruct.noise = W"
% where W is a polytope bounding the disturbance.
%
% A polytopic uncertainty can be specified by a cell array of matrices Aunc and
% Bunc as follows:
%
%    sysStruct.Aunc = {A1, ..., An};
%    sysStruct.Bunc = {B1, ..., Bn}; 
%
% NOTE! sysStruct.A and sysStruct.B are still required even if you want to
% define a system with parametric uncertainties.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% PWA SYSTEMS
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% PWA systems are models for describing hybrid systems. Dynamical behavior of
% such systems is captured by relations of the following form:
%
%    x(k+1) = A_i x(k) + B_i u(k) + f_i
%     y(k)  = C_i x(k) + D_i u(k) + g_i
%
% Each dynamics "i" is defined in a polyhedral partition bounded by the
% so-called guardlines:
%
%   guardX_i x(k) + guardU_i u(k) <= guardC_i
%
% that means dynamics "i" will be applied if the above inequality is satisfied.
%
% Fields of sysStruct describing a PWA system are listed below:
%
%   sysStruct.A = {A1, ..., An}                      
%   sysStruct.B = {B1, ..., Bn}
%   sysStruct.C = {C1, ..., Cn}
%   sysStruct.D = {D1, ..., Dn}
%   sysStruct.f = {f1, ..., fn}                       [optional]
%   sysStruct.g = {g1, ..., gn}                       [optional]
%   sysStruct.guardX = {guardX1, ..., guardXn}
%   sysStruct.guardU = {guardU1, ..., guardUn}        [optional]
%   sysStruct.guardC = {guardC1, ..., guardCn}
%
% Note that all fields have to be cell arrays of matrices of compatible
% dimensions, "n" stands for total number of different dynamics. If
% sysStruct.guardU is not provided, it is assumed to be zero.
%
% MPT is able to deal also with PWA systems which are affected by bounded
% additive disturbances:
%
%   x(k+1) = A_i x(k) + B_i u(k) + f_i + w(k)
%
% where the disturbance w(k) is assumed to be bounded for all time instances by
% some polytope W. To indicate that your system is subject to such a
% disturbance, set 
% 
%   sysStruct.noise = W;
%
% where W is a polytope object of appropriate dimension.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% CONSTRAINTS
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% MPT supports various types of system constraints, such as:
%
% 1. input constraints (MANDATORY!):
%      sysStruct.umin <= u(k) <= sysStruct.umax
%
% 2. output constraints (optional for most cases, sometimes mandatory):
%      sysStruct.ymin <= y(k) <= sysStruct.ymax   - output constraints
%
% 3. state constraints (optional, but recommended to achieve good scaling):
%      sysStruct.xmin <= x(k) <= sysStruct.xmax   - state constraints
%
% 4. constraints on slew rate of inputs (optional):
%      sysStruct.dumin <= u(k) - u(k-1) <= sysStruct.dumax
%
% For tracking problems (probStruct.tracking=1), it is possible to specify
% bounds on reference signals by setting following fields:
% 
%    sysStruct.yrefmax, sysStruct.yrefmin
%    sysStruct.xrefmax, sysStruct.xrefmin
%
% MPT also supports one additional constraint, the so-called Pbnd constraint. If
% you define "sysStruct.Pbnd" as a polytope object of the dimension of your
% state vector, this entry will be used as a polytopic constraint on the initial
% condition, i.e.
% 
%    x0 \in sysStruct.Pbnd
%
% This is especially important for explicit controllers, since "sysStruct.Pbnd"
% there limits the state-space which will be explored.
%
% If "sysStruct.Pbnd" is not specified, it will be set as a "large" box of size
% defined by mptOptions.infbox (see 'help mpt_init' for details).
%
% NOTE! "sysStruct.Pbnd" does NOT impose any constraints on predicted states!
%
% It is also possible to use polytopic constraints on states, inputs and
% outputs, though not directly in the system structure. If you want to use this
% kind of constraints, you need to add them manually using the "Design your own
% MPC" function (see 'help mpt_ownmpc' for an example and more details).
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% OTHERS
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Text labels can be attached to state, input and output variables:
%
% sysStruct.StateName = {'position', 'speed'};
% sysStruct.InputName = 'force';
% sysStruct.OutputName = 'position';
%
% These labels will be used as axis labels when plotting polyhedral partition
% of the explicit controller, or when visualizing trajectories.
%
