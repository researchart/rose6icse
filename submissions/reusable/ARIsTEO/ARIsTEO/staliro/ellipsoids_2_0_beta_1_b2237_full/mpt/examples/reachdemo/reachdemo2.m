% we want to compute N-Step reachable sets for a linear system in the form
% x(k+1) = A*x(k) + B*u(k)
%
% assuming that
%   x(0) \in X0
%   u(k) is driven by an explicit controller

% load dynamical system

probStruct.N = 3;
probStruct.norm = 1; % lower dimensional mappings happen often in 1/Inf norm problems

% compute explicit controller
expc = mpt_control(sysStruct, probStruct);


% define set of initial conditions

% there is one very important point that has to be mentioned:
%
% by default, mpt_reachSets function returns only fully dimensional reachable
% sets. it could happen that certain mappings are lower dimensional, in which
% case you have to tell the function explicitly that you want to compute these
% lower dimensional sets as well.
