% Use shorter prediction horizon => less complex solution

% Construct constraints and objective

% Matrices of polytopic constraints H*x<=K
H = [eye(2); -eye(2)];

% Add the polytopic constraint on each predicted state excluding the initial
% state x0
C = C + set(H * V.x{2} <= K);
C = C + set(H * V.x{3} <= K);

% Compute an explicit controller with custom constraints

% Plot the controller partition. Notice that the feasible set is now NOT
% constrained by H*x0<=K, since we have added said constraint on x1 and x2.

% Simulate the open-loop system

X = sim(ctrl, x0, struct('openloop', 1))

% Notice that 2nd and 3rd element of the open-loop trajectory indeed satisfy
% given polytopic constraints
