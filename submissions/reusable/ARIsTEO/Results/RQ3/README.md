Each files refer to a specific solver (ARISTEO or S-Taliro) and a given value of an iteration pair.
Each line contains the results for one of the benchmark, respectivelt, RHB(1), RHB(1), AT, AFC and IGC (in this order).
The values reported in each row are the number of iterations performed for the runs that found a fault (for the other runs the number of iterations is equal to the upper bound)
