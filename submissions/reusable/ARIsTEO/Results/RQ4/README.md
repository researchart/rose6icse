This folder contains the material related with RQ4.
Specifically, it contains
(a) the detected violations.
(b) the scripts used to run the experiments and

The model used to create the results is not shared as it is part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

Each of the folder contained in Run1 and Run2 contains

(a) the results of one experiments. The Matlab file scriptplot plots a figure that contains
    (i) on the left side an input profile that causes the violation of the property (change on the temperature) -
      note that one of the requirements of our partner was that the temperature should changed consistently among the different components. For this reason, we report only one input. The other inputs are obtained by multiplying this input for a constant and for this reason are not reported.
    (ii) on the right side the error in the attitude of the satellite.
(b) the considered properties and profiles are specified in the ARISTEOSatReqXIPY.m files
