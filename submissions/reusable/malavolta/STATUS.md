This folder contains the artifact submission for the paper published at ICSE SEIP 2020 with the title *How do you Architect your Robots? State of the Practice and Guidelines for ROS-based Systems*.

We are applying for the **Reusable** and **Available** Badges because this repository refers to, among others, the following artifacts:

- The **full dataset** on which the findings of the paper are based;

- All the **Python scripts** we developed for performing each single step we applied for building the dataset (each Python script is executable in isolation);

- All **intermediate data** we produced when building the dataset, each as self-contained artifact;

- The **R script** we developed for analyzing the mined data;

- Other **auxiliary Python scripts**, such as those for cloning GitHub repositories as a bulk operation, programmatically visiting web pages, etc.   

- The README and INSTALL **guides** containing explicit instructions about how to reuse and execute all the software artifacts mentioned above for future studies.

All the software artifacts described above are available in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/S2-group/icse-seip-2020-replication-package](https://github.com/S2-group/icse-seip-2020-replication-package)
